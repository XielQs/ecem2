# ecem2

ecem2 is a basic programming language that is written in TypeScript. Language is designed to be simple and python-like.

ecem2 is a toy project and is NOT intended for production use!!

## Features

- Variables
- (that's it for now)

## Usage

It is highly recommended to use `bun` to use ecem2, but you can also use `tsx` if you want. (`node` doesn't support typescript natively!!)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/XielQs/ecem2
cd ecem2
bun . <file>.ecem
# or
tsx . <file>.ecem
```

## Why is it called ecem2?

Translate:
\- I'm gonna make a programming language, suggest me a name
\+ ecem

I first tried to make it in C++, but I am not good at making compilers in C++. So I switched to TypeScript!! So I named it ecem2, because it is the second version of ecem.
